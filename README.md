## What is the goal of this repository?
### This repository has been created for the Mini Data Analysis assignment for STAT545A. It is broken down into work for Milestones 1 and 2. The goal of this repository is to become familiar with a dataset, create research questions and begin to manipulate and summarize the dataset using dplyr. In addition, I learned how to make graphs and tables with ggplot, work with factors, and model fit. Another goal was to learn how to generate a reproducible and clear report with R Markdown. 
## What is included int he repository? 
### This repository contains multiple files which are listed here: 
#### MiniDataAnalysis1.rmd which is the R markdown version of MiniDataAnalysis1.md file which corresponds to the worksheet for Milestone 1 of the Mini Data Analysis project. 
#### MiniDataAnalysis1_files contains the figures from Milestone 1 
#### BLAH BLAH.rmd is the R markdown version of BLAh BlAH.md which corresponds to the work done for Milestone 2 of the Mini Data Analysis project. 
#### Output folder contains two files the first being apt_building2.csv which is the summary table made in task 1.2 of Milestone 2. The second is an R binary file titled model32.rds which is the model object made in task 3 of Milestone 2. This folder was created for task 4 of Milestone 2.
