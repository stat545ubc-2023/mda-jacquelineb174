## What is the goal of this repository?
### This repository has been created for the Mini Data Analysis assignment for STAT545A. It is broken down into work for Milestones 1 and 2. This repository contains work to become familiar with a dataset, create research questions and begin to manipulate and summarize the dataset using dplyr. In addition, I learned how to make graphs and tables with ggplot, work with factors, and model fit. Another goal was to learn how to generate a reproducible and clear report with R Markdown. 
## What is included in the repository? 
### This repository contains multiple folders which are listed here: 
### MDA_Milestone1 contains MiniDataAnalysis1.md as well as the R markdown version of the file which are the worksheets for Milestone 1 of the Mini Data Analysis project. It also contains the files of the images. 
### MDA_Milestone2 contains MiniDataAnalysis2.md as well as the R Markdown version of the file which are the worksheets for Milestone 2 of the Mini data analysis project. The folder also contains the files for the images. 
### The Output folder contains two files, the first being apt_building2.csv, which is the summary table made in task 1.2 of Milestone 2. The second is an R binary file titled model32.rds, which is the model object made in task 3 of Milestone 2. This folder was created for task 4 of Milestone 2. 
## How to interact with the repository
### Using git, R, or R Studio, clone and open the repository and select the file you want to run. If using R studio, select the file you would like to engage with.
